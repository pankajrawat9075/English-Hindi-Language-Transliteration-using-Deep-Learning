**Instructions to train and evaluate the neural network models:**

1. Open the DL_PA3_final.ipynb file in colab/ kaggle
2. Upload the Aksharantar dataset released by AI4Bharat to your google drive 
3. Run the following cells completely in the DL_PA3_final.ipynb file
    "Importing Libraries and models"
    "Load Dataset"
    "seq2seq model"
    "Helper functions"
    "Training function"
    "Translating predictions to words"
 4. To run the sweeps for the Vanilla Model run "Runnning sweeps for models without Attention" cells
 5. To run the sweeps for the Attention Model run "Runnning sweeps for models with Attention"
 6. To test the Best Hyperparameters for Vanilla Model run "Testing the Best Model(without Attention) on Test Data" cells
 7. To test the Best Hyperparameters for Attention Model run "Testing the Best Model(with Attention) on Test Data" cells
 8. To generate Heat Maps for attention run "Plotting the Attention HeatMaps" cells
